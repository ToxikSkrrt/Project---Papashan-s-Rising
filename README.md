# Project - Papashan's Rising

## Description
This project is a little demo for a Rogue-like game made in Python that I started during my last year in high school.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to finish it, but it is a "bit" playable.  
Also, I am currently working on a remake of this project on Unity to finally finish it and make it fully playable.
